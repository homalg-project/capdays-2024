  <i>However</i>, for organisational purposes (budget planning, workshop

  <b>before May 20</b>.

  We have limited financial support. Priority will be given to young
  participants and early registrations. Please consider registering
  <b>before May 20</b> if you need financial support and mention it in
  the last section of the registration form.
