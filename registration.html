<p>
  However, for organisation purposes (budget planning, workshop
  dinner, boat tour...), we would greatly appreciate if you could
  register before May 20.
</p>

<p>
  We have limited financial support. Priority will be given to young
  participants and early registrations. Please consider registering
  before May 20 if you need financial support and mention it in the
  last section of the registration form.
