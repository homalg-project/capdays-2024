[CAP][CAP] (shorthand for Categories, Algorithms, Programming) is a
software project for algorithmic category theory written in
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org).  It facilitates both the realization
of specific instances of categories and the implementation of generic
categorical algorithms.

The workshop is split into three kinds of activities:

1. Introductory talks about algorithmic category theory (ALCT), [CAP][CAP] as a dialect of ALCT, and [CompilerForCAP][CompilerForCAP].

2. An explicit live show-case implementation of a [category constructor and an explicit categorical tower](https://homalg-project.github.io/docs/CAP_project-based/).

3. Exercise sessions implementing categorical algorithms in CAP. Participants are also invited to implement their own work in CAP and we will be happy to provide help.

The workshop aims at mathematicians, physicists, and computer
scientists who want to learn about applications of algoritmic category
theory and how CAP can be used to structure implementations in a
categorical way.

Program information will be continuously updated on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).
