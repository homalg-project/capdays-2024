[CAP (Categories, Algorithms, Programming)](http://homalg-project.github.io/CAP_project) 
is a software project for constructive category theory written in [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org).
It facilitates both the realization of specific instances of categories and the implementation of generic categorical algorithms.

The workshop is split in three parts:

* On the first day, participants can give talks about their work, and how they have or plan to
  incorporate CAP in their work. The first talk of the day will be an overview about the CAP project
  and some of its capabilities. If you want to give a talk, please mention it in the comments section
  at [the registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration).

* On the second day it is possible to participate in a CAP tutorial, where the first steps
  of organizing code with CAP and implementing a category in CAP will be explained, along
  with examples and exercises. Furthermore, available categories in CAP will be demonstrated.

* On the third and fourth day there will be a coding sprint. Participants are welcome
  to form groups and work on projects of their interest. Help for using CAP and implementing
  categories in CAP is available all the time.

The workshop aims at mathematicians who want to learn about the CAP project,
categorical programming, and structurizing implementations in a categorical way.
The workshop is suitable for both GAP newcomers and veteran GAP programmers.

Program information will be continuously updated on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).
